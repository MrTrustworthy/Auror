# Auror for Alfred3

This is a simple workflow you can use to change your Nanoleaf Aurora effects.

In order to use this, you need to know the IP of your Nanoleaf and have an access token for it. A pretty simple way to get them is via https://github.com/software-2/nanoleaf#setup

Change the 'ip' and 'token' variables in this script to the values you got from the previous step, and you should be able to see available effects and change them once you start typing 'nl' in Alfred. 

If you have multiple Nanoleafs, you can add this workflow a second time and just change the command trigger to something like 'nd' (ex. for Nanoleaf at the desk) on the second workflow.
